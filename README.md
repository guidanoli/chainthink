# Experiment Week 3 Project

## Setup

Make sure you have all the [dependencies](https://docs.mugen.builders/cartesi-co-processor-tutorial/installation) installed.
If you don't want to install the Cartesi CLI globally, you can do `pnpm i` and have the following file in your `PATH`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
pnpm exec cartesi "$@"
```
